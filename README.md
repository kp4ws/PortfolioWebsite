## About
This is my personal portfolio website that I built from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally I used Hugo static site generator for greater maintainability and scalability of my website. As for hosting, I'm using Netlify.

Since I first started working on this project, I've gained a lot of experience in front-end web development. One of the biggest things that stood out for me is how to properly stucture an HTML page with the correct tags, instead of just using div tags everywhere!

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Hugo, Netlify

## Ideas for future iterations
- Add subsections for the skills, e.g. React.js under JavaScript
- Organize skills by front-end and back-end technologies
- Add photos for the projects
- Add popups for each of the cards (Blogs and Projects) where you can expand to see more info
